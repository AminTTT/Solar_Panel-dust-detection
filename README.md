# Solar_Panel-dust-detection
About Dataset: The accumulation of dust on the surface of solar panels reduces the efficiency of the solar modules and hence the amount of produced energy. 
developing an optimal procedure to monitor and clean these panels is very important in order to increase modules efficiency, reduce maintenance cost and reducing the use of resources.
The objective of this dataset is to investigate the ability of different machine learning classifiers to detect dust on solar panel surfaces with the highest possible accuracy.
